## A basic text based adventure game based on Half Life

Yeah, Half-Life is an old game, but it can be made to look even older. What's older than low-poly 3d? Text! Thats right, Half-Life CLI to coming to a terminal near you! So grab that old computer of yours, fire up that clunky CRT box monitor and get playing!

I'm creating this project as a way to develop my understanding of Python for the skills section of my DofE bronze award.
